## Future Enhancements

These are things I'd like to do with this in the future one I learn more about Android dev.

1. implement tests against activitys/adapters/ui
1. validate user input (e.g. require title)
1. animations for transitions (esp. around the floating action button)
1. implement a checkbox on the listview to complete actions
1. implement swipe on the listview to delete the item
1. implement drag and drop on the listview to change order
