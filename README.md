## Future Enhancements

These are things I'd like to do with this in the future one I learn more about Android dev.

1. implement tests against activitys/adapters/ui
1. validate user input (e.g. require title)
1. animations for transitions (esp. around the floating action button)
1. implement a checkbox on the listview to complete actions
1. implement swipe on the listview to delete the item
1. implement drag and drop on the listview to change order
1. implement support for filtering late todos
